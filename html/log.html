You‚Äôll love the Nile. Hate the cold of New England?  Then you‚Äôll love the scorching heat of the Sahara Desert!  If you don‚Äôt, then remember: Your enemies won‚Äôt either. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not too much hotter. The average temperature is only 7 degrees hotter! *In Celsius*  Anyways, why would you choose us over Tigris Homes, in Mesopotamia?  1: A Longer river The Nile River is 4,100 miles long! That‚Äôs an amazing transport system, that supplies us with lots more resources. It‚Äôs bigger than the Tigris and Euphrates combined.  2: Better protection Don‚Äôt you just hate when people burn your house down? Well, Egypt has much better protection than Mesopotamia. The Sahara is hard to get through, and the Nile has natural flowing rapids, called cataracts, that protect you from attack through the water.  3: More predictable weather Over in Mesopotamia, just when you think you‚Äôve finally managed to plant crops in the rocky soil, a flood comes and ruins them all. Here in the Nile Valley, the soil is fertile all year long, and you can prepare for the predictable floods. No complicated irrigation systems needed! Because of the predictable river, we can grow wheat, lettuce, radishes, asparagus, cucumbers, dates, figs, grapes, and watermelons. We even grow our own flax seed for linen and reeds for boats.  We want to keep you informed, so we‚Äôll tell you some problems and how to fix them. 1: The same things that keep others out keeps us in.  True, but you still have one another. This might even help you grow community.  2: There aren‚Äôt that many minerals.  Maybe not in the black lands, or places with black, fertile soil, but the red lands, or super hot deserts are mineral rich!  We‚Äôll hope you choose us.  We‚Äôre Egypt Real Estate. You‚Äôll love the Nile. Advertisement by Bad Advertising Firm, in their worst (or best) work yet.</p><p class='msgln'>User reggiom has left</p><p class='msgln'>User joshfisher has left</p>
